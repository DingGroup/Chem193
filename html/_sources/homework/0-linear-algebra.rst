Linear Algebra 
===============

Linear algebra is essential for understanding and working with machine learning algorithms. `This review <https://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf>`_ covers the basics of linear algebra that you need to know for this course.
Your homework is to read and understand the review.
Although there are no exercises for this homework, it is important that you understand the material well because many of the concepts will be used throughout the course.

If you need a textbook on linear algebra for reference, here are some recommendations:
