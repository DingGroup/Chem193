Numpy & JAX
============

`Numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_ is a popular numerical computing library for Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. `JAX <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is a numerical computing library that has a similar API to Numpy, but provides additional features such as automatic differentiation, automatic vectorization, just-in-time compilation, and GPU/TPU support.

Both Numpy and JAX are widely used in the scientific computing community. Both provide excellent tutorials and documentation.
Following the following tutorials to get started with Numpy and JAX:
